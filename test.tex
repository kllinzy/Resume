            {\sl Elliptic Curve Cryptography} 
            \begin{itemize} 
            \item[] Wrote a python implementation of elliptic curve cryptography with only random, math, and sys
              as external dependencies. The library generates public/private key pairs, encodes/decodes strings
              onto the curves and encrypts/decrypts securely. Limitations are hardware-dependent (performs well
              with 1000 digit integers on laptop-class CPUs).
