            {\sl Elliptic Curve Cryptography}

            \item[] Wrote a python implementation of elliptic curve cryptography with only random, math, and sys

              onto the curves and encrypts/decrypts securely. Limitations are hardware-dependent (performs well
              with 1000 digit integers on laptop-class CPUs).
